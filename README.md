The following is a guide to fixing common problems with electronic devices.

## Phones

*Smart Cell-Phones are very fragile devices that break down easily with no reason.*
While they offer little to no other functionality than displaying text and images on a
screen, many children across the globe are compulsively glued to one such device. As a
result, wear and tear occurs over time, and the device may break down completely.

Here are some common fixes to your worries.

### Phone won't turn on

- Try turning it off and on again.
- Microwave it and see if it wakes up in panic.
- Press all the buttons like a desperate maniac.
- Connect the power cable and soak it in a bowl of organic water.

### Help! I dropped my phone in wine!

- Try boiling it in hot water so the wine will evaporate.
- Put your mouth on it and suck the wine out yourself because wine ain't super cheap.
- Attempt to turn it on, maybe it likes wine.
- Use a blow dryer to dry out the wine.

### My son accidentally ate my phone

- Purchase some ipecac syrup and force your child to drink the entire bottle. 
  Within minutes, you shall retrieve your electronic device back in your possession!
- Praise the child for eating glass, it's good for children's health (proven true by 
  science!)
  
### My phone is really slow
- Sometimes it needs a little encouragement, try tapping and banging it so it wakes up 
  and runs faster. Yelling is also just as effective!
- Apply heat, this gets the molecules in the device moving rapidly and will get your 
  device running up to speed.
  
### My phone is really hot
- This is normal. Add some cilantro, garlic, and a dash of oregano, and enjoy your fresh 
  gourmet meal!
- Give it a shower. It needs to cool down.
- If the heat is bothering your sensitive self, freeze the device until it reaches the 
  desired temperature.
- Take the phone apart, maybe it needs to get some fresh air.
